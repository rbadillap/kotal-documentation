Bootnodes must use node private key, check [nodekey](#nodekey).

## bootnodes

`bootnodes` is ethereum node URLs for p2p network discovery bootstrap.

:::warning
Each Ethereum clients has hardcoded bootnodes for public main and test networks. `bootnodes` will override these bootnodes.

:::

## client

`client` is the Ethereum client name powering the node.

`client` possible values are `besu`, `geth` or `parity`.

Client `geth` or `parity` can't be used if network consensus is `ibft2`.

:snake: Nodes that import accounts can't enable HTTP RPC server, web socket server, or GraphQL server to prevent funds drainage if exposed to the internet.

Account must be imported if the node is running with `geth` or `parity` clients wants to be a signer in proof of authority clique network.
