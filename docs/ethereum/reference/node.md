At least one node is required in a network. A node is Ethereum client (geth, besu or parity) running inside a pod with compute and storage resources and scheduled in a Kubernetes node.

## bootnode

`bootnode` marks the node as a boot node.

The first node in the `spec.nodes` list must be a bootnode with `bootnode: true`

Bootnodes must use node private key, check [nodekey](#nodekey).

## client

`client` is the Ethereum client name powering the node.

`client` possible values are `besu`, `geth` or `parity`.

Client `geth` or `parity` can't be used if network consensus is `ibft2`.

Client `geth` or `parity` can't be used in fixed difficulty proof of work networks, where `spec.consensus` is `pow` and `spec.genesis.ethash.fixedDifficulty` is not null.

## coinbase 

`coinbase` is ethereum account to which mining rewards are paid.

`coinbase` is required if the node is mining `miner: true`.


## corsDomains

`corsDomains` is a list of domains from which to accept cross-origin requests (browser enforced).

Default value `*` will be used if HTTP RPC server is enabled `rpc: true` or web socket server is enabled `ws: true` or graphQL server is enabled `graphql: true`.

## graphql

`graphql` enables the GraphQL server.

:::note
* Parity (OpenEthereum) client doesn't support GraphQL.
* Geth (Go-Ethereum) GraphQL server can be used only if RPC is enabled as of geth [v1.9.19 release](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.9.19)
:::

## graphqlPort

`graphqlPort` GraphQL server listening port.

The default value `8547` will be used if the graphQL server is enabled `graphql: true`.

## hosts

`hosts` is a list of host names to whitelist for RPC access (server enforced).

## import

`import` is the ethereum account to import. Only for nodes running with `geth` or `parity` clients.

During account creation, it will be encrypted with the password, and during import it will be unlocked using the same password.

:snake: Nodes that import accounts can't enable HTTP RPC server, web socket server, or GraphQL server to prevent funds drainage if exposed to the internet.

Account must be imported if the node is running with `geth` or `parity` clients wants to be a signer in proof of authority clique network.

| Syntax      | Type |  Description |
| ----------- |------| ----------- |
| privatekey | string | account private key in hexadecimal |
| password | string | encryption secret |

## logging

`logging` is Ethereum node logging verbosity level.

`logging` possible values are `off`, `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `debug`, `info`, `trace` and `all`.

Different clients support different logging vrbosity levels as shown in the following table:

| Logging/Client      | Hyperledger Besu |  Go Ethereum | Parity (OpenEthereum) |
| ----------- |------| ----------- | -------- |
| `off` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |
| `fatal` | :heavy_check_mark: |  :x:  |   :x:    |
| `error` | :heavy_check_mark: |  :heavy_check_mark:  |   :heavy_check_mark:    |
| `warn` | :heavy_check_mark: |  :heavy_check_mark:  |   :heavy_check_mark:    |
| `debug` | :heavy_check_mark: |  :heavy_check_mark:  |   :heavy_check_mark:    |
| `info` | :heavy_check_mark: |  :heavy_check_mark:  |   :heavy_check_mark:    |
| `trace` | :heavy_check_mark: | :x:   |   :heavy_check_mark:    |
| `all` | :heavy_check_mark: |  :heavy_check_mark:  |    :x:   |

## miner

`miner` enables node mining or signing blocks.

:::note
Parity (OpenEthereum) client doesn't support PoW mining.
:::

## name

`name` is the node name.

`name` is required.

`name` can't be updated (immutable).


## nodekey

`nodekey` is the node private key.

`nodekey` is required if the node is a boot node `bootnode: true`, or if besu node with `client: besu` is a signer in proof of authority clique network or validator in ibft2 network.

## p2pPort

`p2pPort` is node p2p port for communication (TCP) and discovery (UDP).

## resources

`resources` allocates compute and storage resources to the node.

| Syntax      | Type |  Description | Default |
| ----------- |------| ----------- | ---- |
| cpu | string | number of cpu cores this node requires | `2` in private, `4` in public |
| cpuLimit | string | number of cpu cores this node is limited to | `3` in private, `6` in public |
| memory | string | memory this node requires | `4Gi` in private, `8Gi` in public |
| memoryLimit | string | memory this node is limited to | `8Gi` in private, `16Gi` in public |
| storage | string | disk space this node requires | `100Gi` in private, `6Ti` in mainnet with full sync, `750Gi` in mainnet wit fast sync, `25Gi` in public test networks |
| storageClass | string | Node volume storage class | Cluster's default storage class will be used as defined by cluster admin or cloud provider |

memory and storage requests and limits must have use the pattern `^[1-9][0-9]*[KMGTPE]i$` for example `1500Mi`, `30Gi`, and `1Ti`.

cpu requests and limits must have use the pattern `^[1-9][0-9]*m?$` for example `1000m` (which is equal to `1`), `1500m`, `2`, and `4.`

`cpuLimit` can't be less than `cpu`.

`memoryLimit` can't be less than `memory`.

## rpc

`rpc` enables the HTTP RPC server.

## rpcPort

`rpcPort` is the HTTP RPC server listening port.

Default value `8545` will be used if the HTTP RPC server is enabled with `rpc: true`.

## rpcAPI

`rpcAPI` is a list of RPC services to enable.

Default value `["web3", "eth", "net]` will be used if HTTP RPC server is enabeld with `rpc: true`.

## syncMode

`syncMode` is Blockchain synchronization mode.

`syncMode` possible values are `light`, `full` or `fast`.

:snake: Nodes that run with `client: besu` doesn't support `light` sync mode.

## ws

`ws` enables the web socket server.

## wsPort

`wsPort` is the web socket server listening port.

The default value `8546` is used if the web socket server is enabled with `ws: true`.

## wsAPI

`wsAPI` is a list of rpc services to enable.

the default value `["web3", "eth", "net]` will be used if the web socket server is enabeld with `ws: true`.
